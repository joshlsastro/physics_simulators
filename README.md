# Basic Physics Simulators

This is a set of Python programs for physics simulators.

## Prerequisites

You need Python 3 that has the turtle module available.

## How to Run

Open the file you want to run with a Python 3 interpreter. Example on Linux: `python3 [file]`.

If you want a different physics simulation, go and modify the files between `# <For User>` and `# </For User>`.

## What Files Are Available

basic.py is the basic simulator, with a simulation of a spring as an example of modified bodies.

damped_oscillator.py is a simulator of a damped harmonic oscillator.

electrostatics.py allows a user to draw an electric field with lines around any set of objects.

with_fields.py is a gravity simulator with 3 bodies as an example.
